# The Basics of SQL Syntax

In order to understand SQLi, we first need to understand some basics of the SQL language. In SQL, in order to choose some data, we use SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. SELECT allows us to select an object from (FROM) database and choose a specific data using WHERE.

For example, if we have a database called colors and we want to select all colors from the list, we would use this syntax: 

	SELECT * FROM colors; 

Or if you have a database food with different meals followed by calories you could choose all meals with more than 50 calories: 

	SELECT * FROM food WHERE calories > 50;
