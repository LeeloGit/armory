## What is a digital signature
Digital signatures are a way to prove the authenticity of files, to prove who created or modified them. 

## Cryptography
Using asymmetric cryptography, you produce a signature with your private key and it can be verified using your public key. As only you should have access to your private key, this proves you signed the file. Digital signatures and physical signatures have the same value in the UK, legally.
